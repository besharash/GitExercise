# GitExercise
Let’s put everything we’ve learned into practice.
we’ll start by creating a repo in github called git-homework
clone the repo into your local computer
add a file called lines.txt
add another file called trees.txt
add and commit these 2 files with a proper message
add 2 tree names, oak and pine for example to the trees.txt file
commit and push it
go to github and make sure all your changes appear there
add 5 more line to each file, committing each one of them separately (10 commits in total), make sure to push every 2-3 commits
Bonus
delete the lines.txt file commit and push.
revert the 7th commit, and push it.
bring back the lines.txt file by finding the commit that deleted the file (use git log) and reverting it.
